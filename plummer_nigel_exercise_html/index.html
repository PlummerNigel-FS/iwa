        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Carl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 in Switzerland. He showed an early
          interest in language, culture, and religion, influenced by his family
          background.

        <h3>Collaboration with Frued</h3>
        <p>
          Jung worked closely with Sigmund Freud but later broke away due to
          theoretical differences.
        </p>
        <h4>Split from Frued</h4>
        <p>
          Jung disagreed with Freud's emphasis on sexuality and developed his
          own analytical psychology.
